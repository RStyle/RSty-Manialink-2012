<p>It's a Manialink (similar to a website) I created for the game Trackmania United in 2012. On my Manialink you can download my latest Tracks, Skins, Horns..., write in my guest book, chat with other visitor or customize your experience on my manialink.</p>

<a id="so-what-is-a-manialink" class="anchor" href="#so-what-is-a-manialink" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>So what is a manialink?</h3>

<p>Manialinks are like simplified websites, but you can only visit them through the ingame browser of TM United or TM Nations Forever (the free version of the game). They are a very innovative way to let players share their content with other players in the game through the ingame browser. You can e.g. sell your own maps for the ingame currency "Coppers" and get rich (sadly only in the game).
Other popular things you can do on most Manialinks are downloading new car skins, avatars or horns created by the community. Chat with other people in a guest book while listening to some custom background music or just reading the links page to look for new other Manialinks.
Very special is the fact that you have to register your Manialink at <a href="http://official.trackmania.com/tmf-playerpage/main.php">http://official.trackmania.com/tmf-playerpage/main.php</a> to get a URL instead of buying a domain name. If you want to visit my Manialink you just have to type "RSty" in the ingame browser.</p>

<a id="how-to-code-one" class="anchor" href="#how-to-code-one" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to code one?</h3>

<p>You have to learn a lot because Nadeo, the developers of TM United, created a new markup language. Basically you are coding in XML but to use the full potential of Manialinks you have to use a language like PHP to e.g. get the nickname of the player visiting your Manialink or to create an admin panel where you can upload new maps to your Manialink. Of course MySql will help you with that.

<p>The main page is rsty22.php and not index.php. Don't ask me why, I will clean this mess up later.
Back in 2012 I didn't write comments, had a bad coding style (readability is very poor) or to sum it up: I was a bad programmer who only cared if my code worked.</p>
