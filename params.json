  "body": "### What's this project about?\r\nIt's a Manialink (similar to a website) I created for the game Trackmania United in 2012. On my Manialink you can download my latest Tracks, Skins, Horns..., write in my guest book, chat with other visitor or customize your experience on my manialink.\r\n\r\n### So what is a manialink?\r\nManialinks are like simplified websites, but you can only visit them through the ingame browser of TM United or TM Nations Forever (the free version of the game). They are a very innovative way to let players share their content with other players in the game through the ingame browser. You can e.g. sell your own maps for the ingame currency \"Coppers\" and get rich (sadly only in the game).\r\nOther popular things you can do on most Manialinks are downloading new car skins, avatars or horns created by the community. Chat with other people in a guest book while listening to some custom background music or just reading the links page to look for new other Manialinks.\r\nVery special is the fact that you have to register your Manialink at http://official.trackmania.com/tmf-playerpage/main.php to get a URL instead of buying a domain name. If you want to visit my Manialink you just have to type \"RSty\" in the ingame browser.\r\n\r\n### How to code one?\r\nYou have to learn a lot because Nadeo, the developers of TM United, created a new markup language. Basically you are coding in XML but to use the full potential of Manialinks you have to use a language like PHP to e.g. get the nickname of the player visiting your Manialink or to create an admin panel where you can upload new maps to your Manialink. Of course MySql will help you with that.\r\nDocumentation:\r\nEnglish http://wiki.maniaplanet.com/en/Manialinks\r\nGerman http://www.mania-community.de/showthread.php?1482-ManiaPlanet-ManiaLinks\r\n\r\n### Some Notes\r\nThe main page is rsty22.php and not index.php. Don't ask me why, I will clean this mess up later.\r\nBack in 2012 I didn't write comments, had a bad coding style (readability is very poor) or to sum it up: I was a bad programmer who only cared if my code worked.\r\n\r\n### Nice features I created\r\nSharing my own maps, skins, avatars, signs, horns, mods and images\r\nThe first chat with Smileys (managed by PHP)\r\nLink page on which visitors can fill in missing Manialinks\r\nMultiuser Adminpanel - admins can easily delete/edit user comments or upload new stuff\r\nstatistics - how many people visited, on which day, for how long and from country do they come\r\nRating system for downloadable content (1-5 stars)\r\nMultiple languages system\r\n\r\n### Have a look\r\n![Start page](/github/img1.png?raw=true)",
